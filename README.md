# Serial Killer Quiz

Over the summer of 2020, I have decided to create a fun project with my girlfriend. She was beginning her college journey as a forensic psychologist and I have already begun my journey as a computer scientist. Since she was doing research about the psychological behaviors and motives behind a serial killer, I decided to create this app as a way to start my mobile development journey. She came up with the questions and answers, I did the layout/design and coding mechanics behind the app. Even though it was simplistic, it is the only one available on the Google Play store.

## What to Know
- Available on the Google Play Store
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Timed for each question
- Keeps track of high score
- Over 1000+ downloads on Android

## Future of App
The future of the app will be to eventually add a leaderboard, more questions, and hopefully more things to interact with. As it is already a simple concept, there really isn't much more besides that. The sole purpose was to get some experience on the mobile development side. I will eventually add a boilerplate or use a plugin to migrate it to iOS.
